# Blogging Website 🚀

A clean, modern, and fast developer blog built using **Next.js 14 App Router**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Contentlayer**.  
This is my personal space to write about web development, programming tips, and software projects.

> Based on Timlrx's starter blog — restructured, customized, and extended for my own learning and use.
